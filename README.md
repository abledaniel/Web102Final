## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✅] **A create form that allows the user to create posts**
- [✅] **Posts have a title and optionally additional textual content and/or an image added as an external image URL**
- [✅] **A home feed displaying previously created posts**

- [✅] **Clicking on a post shall direct the user to a new page for the selected post**
- [✅] **Users can sort posts by either their created time or upvotes count**
- [✅] **Users can search for posts by title**
- [✅] **A separate post page for each created post, where any additional information is shown is linked whenever a user clicks a post**
- [✅] **Users can leave comments underneath a post on the post's separate page**
- [✅] **Each post should have an upvote button on the post's page. Each click increases its upvotes count by one and users can upvote any number of times**

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
Here is the home page of the website which shows that it searches based on title, sorts based on upvotes and time created, and shows the posts with the title, time created, upvotes count, images, and content:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Often the issues that I would struggle with is getting the functionality to work as intended. That would often involve debugging and testing the code to see if it works. This caused time to be wasted that I think next time wouldn't happened as much streamlining the process.
Though I did not have time to implement the optional features, I think that I would have been able to implement them if I had more time.
I think working with CSS is something I should work on as well as I think that I could have made the website look better.
